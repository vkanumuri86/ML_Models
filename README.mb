House Price Prediction using Simple Linear Regression
Project Overview
This project demonstrates a complete machine learning workflow to predict house prices (specifically price per square foot) using a linear regression model. It covers essential steps including Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), feature engineering, model training, and performance evaluation.

Dataset
The project utilizes a dataset named house_price_regression_dataset.csv. The primary features include:

Square_Footage: The total living area of the house.

Num_Bedrooms / Num_Bathrooms: Count of rooms.

Lot_Size: The total area of the property lot.

Garage_Size: Capacity of the garage.

Neighborhood_Quality: A metric representing the quality of the area.

Year_Built: The year the house was constructed.

House_Price: The total market value (target variable for initial analysis).


Methodology
1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Data Inspection: Checking for missing values (none found) and duplicate entries.

Statistical Summary: Using .describe() to understand the distribution of the data.

Correlation Analysis: Generating a correlation matrix and heatmap to identify relationships between different features.

2. Feature Engineering
House Age: Calculated by subtracting the Year_Built from the current year (2025).

Price per Square Foot: Created as a more standardized target variable for prediction.

3. Model Building
Data Split: The dataset is divided into training and testing sets (80/20 split).

Algorithm: A Linear Regression model from the sklearn library is used to learn the relationship between the features and the target variable.

4. Evaluation
The model's performance is measured using standard regression metrics:

Mean Squared Error (MSE)

Mean Absolute Error (MAE)

Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)

R² Score: To determine how well the independent variables explain the variance in price.

Technologies Used
Python: Primary programming language.

Pandas & NumPy: For data manipulation and numerical operations.

Matplotlib & Seaborn: For data visualization and heatmaps.

Scikit-learn: For model training, data splitting, and performance metrics.
